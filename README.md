# MegaBeetle EUROBOT

For our Embedded Project Course, we were tasked with participating in the Eurobot competition. The primary objective was to design and build a robot capable of transporting plants from one designated area to another, all while avoiding any collisions with the opposing team's robot.

Our robot boasts the following features:

- **Movement with Mecanum Wheels Controlled by an Arduino Uno**: This system enables our robot to move in all directions, including left, right, forward, backward, and even allows it to rotate. The use of mecanum wheels provides superior maneuverability, which is crucial for navigating the competition field efficiently and avoiding obstacles.

- **Display of Score and Team Selection Using a 16x2 LCD Screen and a Raspberry Pi Pico**: One of the requirements to qualify for the competition is the ability to display the score in real-time during the match. Our robot is equipped with a 16x2 LCD screen driven by a Raspberry Pi Pico, ensuring that the current score and team selection are prominently displayed throughout the competition.

This repository contains the comprehensive code and necessary documentation for these various elements. You will find all the essential programming required to manage the robot's movements and display functions, enabling it to perform effectively during the Eurobot competition.
